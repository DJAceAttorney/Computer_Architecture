# Scoreboard project
Designed a program that computes the scoreboard table for a set of MIPS instructions. The program also displays the available registers (32 integer registers and 32 floating point registers) and what values are stored in each registers. The program handles different hazards such as pipeline, read after write (raw), write after read (war), and write after write (waw) hazards.
